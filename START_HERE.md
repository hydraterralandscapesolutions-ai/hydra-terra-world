## ⚠️ Critical Information First

### About Google Sites
**Your HTML code CANNOT be uploaded to Google Sites directly.** 

Google Sites doesn't support custom HTML file uploads. It only has a drag-and-drop page builder.

### The Solution

You have **two options**:

#### ✅ Option 1: GitHub Pages (Recommended - 5 Minutes)
- ✅ Works with your code **as-is**
- ✅ Free forever
- ✅ Supports your custom domain (HYDRA-TERRA.COM.AU)
- ✅ No manual work needed
- ✅ Professional hosting

#### ⚠️ Option 2: Google Sites (30-60 Minutes)
- ⚠️ Must manually recreate everything
- ⚠️ Lose your custom styling
- ⚠️ Custom domain requires paid Google Workspace
- ⚠️ Significant effort
